# Functions

## functions ----> let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements)

## you declare a function using the fuction keyword

## to create a function you give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces this is known as a "function declaration"

## the function name sometimes called an indetifier follow by parentheses

## the statement that perform the task sit in a code block ther are inside the culry braces

## having declared the function you can then execute all of the statements between its curly braces with just one line of code this is known as calling the function

## sometimes a function need specific information to perform its task in such cases when you declare the function you give it parameters inside the fucntion the paramaters acr like variables

## when you call afunction that has parameters you specify the calues it should use in the parentheses that follow its name the values are called arguments and they can be provided as values or variables

## some fucntions return information to the code that called them for example when they perform a calculation they return the result
