# colors 

## color can really bring you pages to life :)

## forgorund color : The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways

1. rgb values These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. For example: rgb(100,100,90)
2. hex codes These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and bluein a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign. For example: #ee3e80
3. color names There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. For example: DarkCyan

## We look at these three different ways of specifying colors on the next double-page spread

## CSS3 has also introduced another way to specify colors called HSLA

## Background Color

## CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears in a box, and the background-color property sets the color of the background for that box , You can specify your choice of background color in the same three ways you can specify foreground colors: RGB values, hex codes, and color names , If you do not specify a background color, then the background is transparent , By default, most browser windows have a white background, but browser users can set a background color for their windows, so if you want to be sure that the background is white you can use the background-color property on the (body) element

## Understanding Color

## Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker

## Computer monitors are made up of thousands of tiny squares called pixels (if you look very closely at your monitor you should be able to see them).When the screen is not turned on, it's black because it's not emitting any light. When it's on, each pixel can be a different color, creating a picture.The color of every pixel on the screen is expressed in terms of a mix of red, green, and blue â€” just like on a television screen

## RGB ValuesValues for red, green, and blue are expressed as numbers between 0 and 255

## Hex CodesHex values represent values for red, green, and blue in hexadecimal code

## Color NamesColors are represented by predefined names. However, they are very limited in number

## Hue is near to the colloquial idea of color. Technically speaking however, a color can also have saturation and brightness as well as hue

## SaturationSaturation refers to the amount of gray in a color. At maximum saturation, there would be no gray in the color. At minimum saturation, the color would be mostly gray

## Brightness (or "value") refers to how much black is in a color. At maximum brightness, there would be no black in the color. At minimum brightness, the color would be very dark

## Contrast : When picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be legible

## Text is harder to read when there is low contrast between background and foreground colors

## Text is easier to read when there is higher contrast between background and foreground colors

## For long spans of text, reducing the contrast a little bit improves readability

## A lack of contrast is particularly a problem for those with visual impairments and color blindness , If you want people to read a lot of text on your page, however, then too much contrast can make it harder to read, too , You can reduce contrast by using dark gray text on a white background or an off-white text on a dark background  , It also affects those with poor monitors and sunlight on their screens (which is increasingly common as people use handheld devices outdoors)

## Summary

1. Color not only brings your site to life but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions
2. There are three ways to specify colors in CSS: RGB values, hex codes, and color names
3. Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
4. It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).
5. CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
6. CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.
