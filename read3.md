## Headings : typing ' # ' one or more times before a title/heading controls the size of it

## -----

## Listing : *Adding a '* ' before a list item adds a bullet point. *If you tabbed in then used the '* ' then it'll be a nested list item and will show up as empty bullet point

## ------

## Styling

1. **Adding two ' * ' before and after a word/sentence will make it bold.**
2. *Adding one '* ' before and after a word/sentence will make it italic.*
3. ~~Adding two ' ~ ' before and after a word/sentence will strikethough it.~~

## Nested Styling

1. **This text is not all _italic_ but bold**
2. ***This text is all in italic and bold***

## Quoting

1. If I am quoting text I can add ' > ' before it like: > "This is fun!"
2. If I am quoting a code I can use triple backticks to format it into a block
