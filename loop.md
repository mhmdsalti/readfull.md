# reading for the assignment

## the first thing we have here is about the COMPARISON OPERATORS

1. == is equal to this operator compares two values
2. != is not equal to this operator compares two values to see if they are not the same
3. === strict equal to this operator compares two values to check that both the data type and value are the same
4. !==  strict not equal to this operator compares two values to check that both the data type and value are not the same
5. > greater than this operator check if the number on the left is greater than the number on the right
6. < less than this operator check if the number on the left is less than the number on the right
7. >= greater than or eqaul to this operator check if the number on the left is greater than the number on the right or equal to it
8. <= less than or equal to this operator check if the number on the left is less than the number on the right or equal to it

## the second thing we hvae here is about the LOGICAL OPERATORS , it return single calues of true or false

> && (and) operator this tests more than one condition

- (true && true returns true)
- (true && false returns false)
- (false && true returns false)
- (false && false returns false)

> (or) operator this test at least one condition

- (true || false rutruns true)
- (false || true rutruns true)
- (true || true rutruns true)
- (false || false rutruns false)

> ! (not) operator this take a single boolean value and inverts it

- !true returns false
- !false returns true

## here we are gonna talk a little bit about loops

1. (for loop) if you need to run code a specific number of times use a for loop, in a for loop the condition is usually a couunter which is used to tell how many times the loop should run | for (condition , counter){code to excute during loop}
2. (while loop) if you dont know how many times the code should run you can use a while loop, here the condition can be something other than a counter and the code will continue to loop for as long as the condition  is true
3. (do while) the do ... while loop is very similar to the while loop but has one key differnce it will always run the statements inside the curly braces at least once even if the  condition evaluates to false
