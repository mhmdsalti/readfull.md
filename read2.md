## Git : is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in any set of files, originally designed for coordinating work among programmers cooperating on source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows

## GitHub : is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git, plus its own features

## We mainly need A-C-P commands to work the basic features of git on our software files -

1. git add filename
2. git commit -m "message"
3. git push

## Before these steps either we create our own git init or we clone it from a repository using: git clone repolink

## To get the changes made elsewhere on our files we use: git pull
